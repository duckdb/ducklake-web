title: Schema Evolution
---

DuckLake supports the evolution of the schemas of tables without requiring any data files to be rewritten. The schema of a table can be changed using the `ALTER TABLE` statement. The following statements are supported:

## Adding Columns / Fields

```sql
-- add a new column of type INTEGER, with default value NULL
ALTER TABLE tbl ADD COLUMN new_column INTEGER;
-- add a new column with an explicit default value
ALTER TABLE tbl ADD COLUMN new_column VARCHAR DEFAULT 'my_default';
```

Fields can be added to columns of type `struct`. The path to the `struct` column must be specified, followed by the name of the new field and the type of the new field.

```sql
-- add a new field of type INTEGER, with default value NULL
ALTER TABLE tbl ADD COLUMN nested_column.new_field INTEGER;
```

## Dropping Columns / Fields

```sql
-- drop the top-level column `new_column` from the table
ALTER TABLE tbl DROP COLUMN new_column;
```

Fields can be dropped by specifying the full path to the field.

```sql
-- drop the field `new_field` from the struct column `nested_column`
ALTER TABLE tbl DROP COLUMN nested_column.new_field;
```

### Renaming Columns / Fields

```sql
-- rename the top-level column "new_column" to "new_name"
ALTER TABLE tbl RENAME new_column TO new_name;
```

Field scan be renamed by specifying the full path to the field.

```sql
-- rename the field "new_field" within the struct column "nested_column" to "new_name"
ALTER TABLE tbl RENAME nested_column.new_field TO new_name;
```

## Type Promotion

The [types]({% link docs/stable/specification/data_types.md %}) of columns can be changed.

```sql
-- change the type of col1 to BIGINT
ALTER TABLE tbl ALTER col1 SET TYPE BIGINT;
-- change the type of field "new_field" within the struct column "nested_column" to BIGINT
ALTER TABLE tbl ALTER nested_column.new_field SET TYPE BIGINT;
```

Note that not all type changes are valid. Only _type promotions_ are supported.
Type promotions must be lossless. As such, valid type promotions are promoting from a narrower type (`int32`) to a wider type (`int64`).

The full set of valid type promotions is as follows:

| Source    | Target                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `int8`    | `int16`, `int32`, `int64`    |
| `int16`   | `int32`, `int64`             |
| `int32`   | `int64`                      |
| `uint8`   | `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64` |
| `uint16`  | `uint32`, `uint64`           |
| `uint32`  | `uint64`                     |
| `float32` | `float64`                    |

## Field Identifiers

Columns are tracked using **field identifiers**. These identifiers are stored in the `column_id` field of the [`ducklake_column` table]({% link docs/stable/specification/tables/ducklake_column.md %}).
The identifiers are also written to each of the data files.
For Parquet files, these are written in the [`field_id`](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/f1fd3b9171aec7a7f0106e0203caef88d17dda82/src/main/thrift/parquet.thrift#L550) field.
These identifiers are used to reconstruct the data of a table for a given snapshot.

When reading the data for a table, the schema together with the correct field identifiers is read from the [`ducklake_column` table]({% link docs/stable/specification/tables/ducklake_column.md %}).
Data files can contain any number of columns that exist in that schema, and can also contain columns that do not exist in that schema.

- If we drop a column, previously written data files still contain the dropped column.
- If we add a column, previously written data files do not contain the new column.
- If we change the type of a column, previously written data files contain data for the column in the old type.

To reconstruct the correct table data for a given snapshot, we must perform _field id remapping_. This is done as follows:

- Data for a column is read from the column with the corresponding `field_id`. The data types might not match in case of type promotion. In this case, the values must be cast to the correct type of the column.
- Any column that has a `field_id` that exists in the data file but not in the table schema must be ignored
- Any column that has a `field_id` that does not exist in the data file must be replaced with the `initial_default` value in the [`ducklake_column` table]({% link docs/stable/specification/tables/ducklake_column.md %})
