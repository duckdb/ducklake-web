DuckLake specifies multiple different data types for field values, and also supports nested types.
The types of columns are defined in the `column_type` field of the `ducklake_column` table.

| `uuid`          | [Universally unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) |

## Nested Types

DuckLake supports nested types and primitive types. Nested types are defined recursively, i.e.,
in order to define a column of type `INT[]` two columns are defined. The top-level column is of type `list`, which has a child column of type `int32`.

The following nested types are supported:

| Type     | Description                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `list`   | Collection of values with a single child type |
| `struct` | A tuple of typed values                       |
| `map`    | A collection of key-value pairs               |
