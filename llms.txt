# DuckLake

> DuckLake is an open table format and a lakehouse format.
> DuckLake supports schema evolution, snapshots, time travel and fully ACID multi-table transactions.
> It was built with simplicity in mind, so it requires only two components: a SQL-compliant catalog database and a storage layer for Parquet files.

Things to remember when using DuckLake:

- DuckLake has some interoperability other open table formats such as Apache Iceberg.

- DuckDB has first-class DuckLake support through its [`ducklake` extension](https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/duckdb/introduction). When using DuckLake from DuckDB, a DuckLake behaves just like any other DuckDB database. See the [list of unsupported features](https://ducklake.select/docs/stable/duckdb/unsupported_features).

- DuckLake has been released in May 2025. It has not yet reached version 1.0 and is still considered experimental.
